What is Offset?
===============

Offset is a credit card powered by trust between people. Payments in Offset are
secure, fast and :doc:`privacy preserving <privacy>`. In addition,
Offset lets you pay with any currency you like.

You can pay with Offset at the local grocery store by scanning
a QR code, or buy something online from the other side of the world, even
from someone you have never met. As a merchant, Offset gives you the freedom to
sell without having to pay the extra fees to a payment processor.

Most importantly, Offset gives **you** the control. Offset is free and `open
source <https://www.github.com/freedomlayer/offset>`_. There is no single
"Offset server", as Offset is fully decentralized. Your Offset credits fit
nicely into your mobile phone, and you are the only one having control
over those credits. 

To use Offset you don't need a previous credit history, a bank account, id
card, phone number or even an email address. You can open as many Offset cards
as you like, without having to pay any fees. Your Offset cards can not be
frozen, and your transactions can not be tracked.

Offset moves the power of issuing money :doc:`from the state to the market
participants <economic>`. Therefore, Offset credits are :doc:`protected from
inflation <inflation>`. While the currencies of the world are constantly
depreciating in value, Offset credits hold to their original value.
