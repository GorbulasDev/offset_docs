The Offset project needs your support!

Project scope
-------------

Offset is an open source project, currently split between a few repositories:

* `Offset core <https://www.github.com/freedomlayer/offset>`_, containing the
  core protocol and logic behind Offset.

* `Offset mobile app <https://www.github.com/freedomlayer/offset_mobile>`_,
  containing mostly UI code for the Offset mobile app.

* `Offset documentation <https://www.github.com/freedomlayer/offset_docs>`_,
  containing Offset documentation (The document you are reading right now)

How can I help?
---------------

* Development: Offset is far from complete. There are many features
  to add and many bugs to fix. Check out the issues pages on the Offset
  repositories and see if there is any issue you would like to help solve.

* Bug reports: If you find any issue with Offset, or have an interesting idea,
  don't hesitate to open an issue here at the relevant repository.

* Documentation: If you find a mistake in the documentation, or have
  something to add, don't hesitate to fork the documentation repository and
  send us a pull request.

* Design: The Offset website and the Offset app user interface are still a work
  in progress.  If you have the skills to make it look better, don't hesitate
  to contact us.

* Spread the message: Show the Offset app to your friends, and teach them how
  to use it.
