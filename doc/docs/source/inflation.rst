Protection from Inflation
=========================

Offset moves the power of issuing money from the state to the market
participants. Therefore, Offset credits are protected from inflation.

What is inflation?
------------------

Imagine a living in 1970, having 1000 US dollars in your bank account. Now imagine
you fell asleep for 50 years, waking up in the year 2020. 

After the first moments of cultural shock, witnessing all the new roads, cars,
skyscrapers and mobile phones, at some point you will (unhappily) notice that
your 1000 US dollars you have in the bank have became much less valuable than
they used to be. An item that costs 10 US dollars in 2020 probably costed only
1.5 US dollars back in 1970!

TODO: Add an image, possibly inflation chart of US dollar.

How can the value of the currency be measured? One way to do it is to track,
over a long period of time, how much it costs to buy an [average basket of
goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index), and see how it
changes over time. We deduce that money loses its value over time, if the price
of goods generally increases over time.

Money depreciation is not special to US dollars. People in most countries of
the world experience a similar phenomenon. Money depreciates in value as time
passes. This phenomenon is called [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation).


Control over money supply
--------------------------

Governments in modern countries usually have control over the money supply
[1]_. This means that governments can create new money and insert it into the
market. Inflation is usually caused by the state, inserting money into the
market faster than the market produces new goods. In small doses, inflation is
considered to be a healthy enabler of long term market growth.

By handing the government the power of creating money, we trust our governments
to use this power wisely, helping create healthy economic markets.
Unfortunately, along the history, governments again and again abused their
power of controlling the money supply for short term, and sometimes corrupt
motives.

Assume for a moment that you were the king of a country, wanting to wage war
over some other country. Wars are very expensive, and you find that you do not
have enough money to fund the war. What could you do to get more money?

One way would be to ask for higher taxes from your citizens, but then the
citizens of the country could protest against the high taxes. In fact, finding
out about the high costs of the war, some citizens might prefer to not start a
war at all.

A much easier way to collect the money is to use your control over the money
supply, and just print it. You could print many new bills, and use those bills
to pay for the war [2]_. This is a stealthy way to tax all the citizens of the
country. 

At first the citizens will not notice that they were taxed. 
As the new money bills enter the market (faster than the market grows), the
prices of all the goods in the market will start rising, causing inflation. By
the time inflation hits enough time have passed. The citizens of the country
might not be able to connect between the money printing and the inflation.

TODO: Add image showing inflation rate during some war somewhere?

Except for wars, printing new money could also be used as a band aid for
overspending of the government, or for dealing with unexpected disasters.


Dangers of inflation
--------------------

High inflation rates distort the value of money and damage the ability to
trade.

Let's look at an example. Consider two merchants, Bob and Charli, living in the
same community. Bob owns a bakery, and Charli is a chocolate artist,
selling her famous chocolate bars.

Assume that one loaf of bread at Bob's bakery costs 1USD, and one chocolate bar
at Charli's shop costs 2USD.

   The control over the money supply sometimes take other forms than the direct
   ability to print new money.

   When asked, you could delighfully reply that "by printing new money you make
   the country richer".
